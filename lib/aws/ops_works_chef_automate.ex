  AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate

  A service that runs and manages configuration management servers.

  Glossary of terms

  <ul> <li> **Server**: A server is a configuration management server, and
  can be highly-available. The configuration manager runs on your instances
  by using various AWS services, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2),
  and potentially Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS). A server is a
  generic abstraction over the configuration manager that you want to use,
  much like Amazon RDS. In AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate, you do not start
  or stop servers. After you create servers, they continue to run until they
  are deleted.

  </li> <li> **Engine**: The specific configuration manager that you want to
  use (such as `Chef`) is the engine.

  </li> <li> **Backup**: This is an application-level backup of the data that
  the configuration manager stores. A backup creates a .tar.gz file that is
  stored in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket in your account. AWS
  OpsWorks for Chef Automate creates the S3 bucket when you launch the first
  instance. A backup maintains a snapshot of all of a server's important
  attributes at the time of the backup.

  </li> <li> **Events**: Events are always related to a server. Events are
  written during server creation, when health checks run, when backups are
  created, etc. When you delete a server, the server's events are also
  deleted.

  </li> <li> **AccountAttributes**: Every account has attributes that are
  assigned in the AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate database. These attributes
  store information about configuration limits (servers, backups, etc.) and
  your customer account.

  </li> </ul> Throttling limits

  All API operations allow for 5 requests per second with a burst of 10
  requests per second.

  Creates an application-level backup of a server. While the server is
  `BACKING_UP`, the server can not be modified and no additional backup can
  be created.

  Backups can be created for `RUNNING`, `HEALTHY` and `UNHEALTHY` servers.

  This operation is asnychronous.

  By default 50 manual backups can be created.

  A `LimitExceededException` is thrown then the maximum number of manual
  backup is reached. A `InvalidStateException` is thrown when the server is
  not in any of RUNNING, HEALTHY, UNHEALTHY. A `ResourceNotFoundException` is
  thrown when the server is not found. A `ValidationException` is thrown when
  parameters of the request are not valid.

  @doc """
  Creates and immedately starts a new Server. The server can be used once it
  has reached the `HEALTHY` state.

  This operation is asnychronous.

  A `LimitExceededException` is thrown then the maximum number of server
  backup is reached. A `ResourceAlreadyExistsException` is raise when a
  server with the same name already exists in the account. A
  `ResourceNotFoundException` is thrown when a backupId is passed, but the
  backup does not exist. A `ValidationException` is thrown when parameters of
  the request are not valid.

  By default 10 servers can be created. A `LimitExceededException` is raised
  when the limit is exceeded.

  When no security groups are provided by using `SecurityGroupIds`, AWS
  OpsWorks creates a new security group. This security group opens the Chef
  server to the world on TCP port 443. If a KeyName is present, SSH access is
  enabled. SSH is also open to the world on TCP port 22.

  By default, the Chef Server is accessible from any IP address. We recommend
  that you update your security group rules to allow access from known IP
  addresses and address ranges only. To edit security group rules, open
  Security Groups in the navigation pane of the EC2 management console.
